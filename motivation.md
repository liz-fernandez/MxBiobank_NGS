## Why Version Control?

Let some software handle the versions of your project let you focus on your
project

## Version Control Features

- history of all changes: what, when, and by whom was changed
- revert to any previous version
- collaborate in the same files without fearing conflicts

## Two main concepts

- *commit*: a recorded set of changes in your project's file
- *repository*: the history of all your project's commits

## Why Git & Github?

- no need for a server: easy to set up
- GitHub's strong community: easy to ask for help
