## [A Better Kind of Backup](01-backup.html)

*   Use `git config` to configure
    a user name, email address, editor, and other preferences once per machine.
*   `git init` initializes a repository.
*   `git status` shows the status of a repository.
*   Files can be stored in a project's working directory (which users see),
    the staging area (where the next commit is being built up)
    and the local repository (where snapshots are permanently recorded).
*   `git add` puts files in the staging area.
*   `git commit` creates a snapshot of the staging area in the local repository.
*   Always write a log message when committing changes.
*   `git diff` displays differences between revisions.
*   `git checkout` recovers old versions of files.
*   The `.gitignore` file tells Git what files to ignore.

## [Collaborating](02-collab.html)

*   A local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repositories.
*   Use the HTTPS protocol to connect to remote repositories until you have learned how to set up SSH.
*   `git push` copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
*   `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
*   `git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository
    with a remote called `origin` automatically set up.

## [Conflicts](03-conflict.html)

*   Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same time.
*   The version control system does not allow people to blindly overwrite each other's changes.
    Instead, it highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved.

## [Open Science](04-open.html)

*   Open scientific work is more useful and more highly cited than closed.
*   People who incorporate GPL'd software into theirs must make theirs open;
    most other open licenses do not require this.
*   The Creative Commons family of licenses allow people to mix and match
    requirements and restrictions on attribution,
    creation of derivative works,
    further sharing,
    and commercialization.
*   People who are not lawyers should not try to write licenses from scratch.
*   Projects can be hosted on university servers,
    on personal domains,
    or on public forges.
*   Rules regarding intellectual property and storage of sensitive information apply
    no matter where code and data are hosted.
